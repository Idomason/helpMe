# Help ME

A platform where go to request for help (it could be help of any kind from the listed categories), these requests gets assigned to the appropriate helpers who would end the request - help circle by meeting the need of the helpee (i.e the one who requested for the help).

Currently, two official links are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) where users can click to become helper/philanthropists or
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) where users can become helpees.

## How Help Me Works

This platform works in 3 simple steps:

- A user in need posts a request, specifying the type of help required and any relevant details.

- Interested helpers review the request and offer their assistance. The platform may match helpers based on their skills, location, or other criteria.

- The platform facilitates communication and payment between helper and helpee. The helper receives rewards for completing the help, and the helpee provides feedback.
